TDD Improvement Plan

  Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3)

  1. Reorganize test structure → New directories and logical separation
  2. Create fixtures/helpers → Reusable test utilities and real app
  instances
  3. Plan mapping → User stories to test scenarios

  Phase 2: Core Tests (Steps 4-5)

  4. Pure unit tests → Keep model tests, remove over-mocking
  5. Integration tests → Real navigation flows between screens

  Phase 3: Behavior Tests (Steps 6-7)

  6. UI behavior tests → User interactions, not implementation details
  7. E2E scenarios → Complete user workflows (todo creation → timeline
  view)

  Phase 4: Infrastructure (Steps 8-9)

  8. Update test runner → Support new structure, better reporting
  9. Documentation → Guidelines for future TDD development
