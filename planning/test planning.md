 Complete TDD Improvement Implementation Plan     
     
 Current Status: 30% Complete   
  
 âœ… Completed: Test directory restructure, fixtures and helpers createdðŸ”„  
  Next Steps: Implementation of remaining 7 phases
  
 Remaining Implementation Plan  
  
 Phase 1: Clean Up Current Structure  
  
 - Update conftest.py to use new fixtures   
 - Fix import paths in moved test files     
 - Update run_tests.py for new directory structure
  
 Phase 2: Refactor Unit Tests (Pure Business Logic)     
  
 - Keep test_models.py as-is (already good TDD)   
 - Refactor test_timeline.py to remove UI mocking 
 - Focus on business logic only 
  
 Phase 3: Create Real Integration Tests     
  
 - Replace mock-heavy test_navigation.py with real screen flow tests
 - Create test_screen_interactions.py for actual UI behavior  
 - Test real navigation paths using fixtures
  
 Phase 4: Build Behavior-Focused Tests
  
 - Create test_user_workflows.py testing user stories   
 - Test actual button clicks and screen transitions     
 - Verify user can complete real tasks
  
 Phase 5: E2E User Scenarios    
  
 - test_todo_management_flow.py: Create task â†’ Set times â†’ View timeline  
 - test_navigation_flows.py: Complete user journeys     
 - Test real user scenarios end-to-end
  
 Phase 6: Update Test Infrastructure  
  
 - Update run_tests.py with new test categories (unit/integration/e2e)    
 - Add test reporting for different test types    
 - Configure pytest for new structure 
  
 Phase 7: Documentation & Guidelines  
  
 - Create TESTING.md with TDD guidelines    
 - Document test categories and when to use each  
 - Provide examples of good vs bad test practices 
  
 Expected Outcomes  
  
 - Better TDD: Tests focus on behavior, not implementation    
 - Less Brittle: Tests survive refactoring  
 - More Meaningful: Tests match user stories
 - Maintainable: Clear separation of concerns     
 - Comprehensive: Unit â†’ Integration â†’ E2E coverage     
  
 Estimated Time: ~2-3 hours for complete implementation 
 Files to Modify: 8 test files, 2 config files, 1 documentation file
